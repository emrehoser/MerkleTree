Packages
It is important for you to understand package types. There are three types of packages:

Changeable
You can change the files in these packages. Note that the regions that you are allowed to change are restricted. Make sure that you change only the regions that are marked.
For example question package.
Usable
You can use them, but you should not change them. During grading, these files are replaced with the originals. Therefore, any change that you made will be lost. When this replacement is done, your code may not compile or may not work as intended although during exam, i.e., with your modifications, it could have been working.
For example do_not_modify package.
ForYourEyesOnly
These are the packages that contain files to help you such as open book material or "cheat sheets". You are free to benefit from them but you should not change or refer them in your solutions because these files will be removed before grading. Since they are unavailable during grading, any dependency on these packages will cause your code not to compile/run.
For example openbook package.
Modification
All your modifications must be between the markers:
// YOUR_EDIT_STARTS_BELOW_THIS_LINE
// YOUR_EDIT_ENDS_ABOVE_THIS_LINE
All changes made in other places will be lost.
If you modify/delete the markers, we will not be able to extract your answer, and you may receive zero. SO, DON'T TOUCH THE MARKERS.
Testing during exam
You are given a test suit to check your code in codes.teaching.testing.student package under the "testing" folder. We recommend that you use this test suite during the exam/quiz. It will give you a sense of what is expected.
Run codes.teaching.testing.student.ExamJUnitCases as JUnit.
Make modifications so that your code passes one test at a time. Then, modify your code to pass one more test.
Submit your code each time it passes one more test case so that your last submission has a running and relatively better code.
However, note that these test cases do not cover all possible cases to be used in grading.
These test cases are not used as it is during grading but similar test are. So, passing these test does not guarantee to get full score in the exam.
There may be additional test cases that we expect you to think about.
If you are through with the test cases, you are welcome to add new test cases.
Note that the content of codes.teaching.testing.student package will not be used in grading.
Submission
We will grade only your last submission before the deadline. All submissions after the deadline will be simply ignored.
Make sure your code compiles before you submit.
It is recommended that you submit your code every time you pass a new test case.
Good Luck!
